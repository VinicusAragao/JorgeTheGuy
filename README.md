# Other Info
- Right now all the descriptions and item names(and to-do code comments) are in my native language, but I plan on translating them to english as well.
  
- This game started as more of a way to practice drawing pixelart(it's folder in my machine is literaly called "side-thing"), but I gradually added code and ideas from previous projects.  
- I plan to be finished with it until the end of the year.
